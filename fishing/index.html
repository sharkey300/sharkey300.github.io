    <p>I love this video because it perfectly captures the feeling of being a fisherman. I can relate to each and every one of the shots in the video, and the songs perfectly match the mood of each scene. I can relate to the first shot, where the person is fishing with the caption "I always say "morning" instead of "good morning" because if it was a good morning I'd be fishing". This is how I feel every single morning. I wake up early, before the sun is even up, and I head to my favorite spot to fish. I love the peace and quiet of the morning, and I love the feeling of being the only one out on the water. I can also relate to the shot of the person fishing with the caption "A bad day of fishing is still better than a good day at work". This is how I feel every single day. I would much rather be out on the water, even if I'm not catching any fish, than be stuck in an office all day. I can relate to the shot of the person fishing with the caption "Listen to a podcast? I'd rather listen to my rod cast". I would much rather be out fishing than sitting inside listening to a podcast. I can relate to the shot of the person fishing with the caption "Sorry I missed your call, I was on the other line". I've missed a lot of calls because I was out fishing. And I'm not even sorry about it. I can relate to the shot of the person fishing with the caption "Happiest day of my life! That's me in the back". Fishing is my happy place. It's where I go to clear my head and just relax. And I'm so happy that I was able to capture that feeling in this video.</p>
